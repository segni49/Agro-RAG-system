INTRODUCTION The term pest has been in the plant protection dictionary for more than a century. The origin of the term pest is that at first, in late 15th century, this was a term for the bubonic plague. It comes via French peste from Latin pestis ‘plague’. Pest in the sense of ‘a d estructive plant or animal’ is not found until the mid -18th century, wh

In the long past history of crop production, farmed crops have been suffering from pests and diseases causing pathogens with a large lo ss in yield with the ever present possibility of famine.

The first organized manual on recommended insecticides was pub lished by IAR (Crowe and Shitaye, 1970). This happened after the time when the side effects of the use of insecticides in agriculture and public health were fully recognized by Entomologists of the time in North America (PNAS, 1969).

However, to the presen t date synthetic insecticides have remained to be very important in managing pests on crops being grown in many areas across the country.

This was conducted about thirty -five years after crop protection was started in the country. Although there were research outputs on id

Crop protection recommendations on economic pests are normally incorpora ted in the crop production packages, however due to the low emphasis given to pest management in the packages, the following gaps were created during practical implementation of acquired knowledge: failure by trainers to communicate the full picture of eco nomic pests and the corresponding management information, miscommunication of crop protection related information to users,

esponding management information, miscommunication of crop protection related information to users, misidentification of pests and wrong recommendations provided to farmers who sought technical support on pests causing significant economic damage on their crops, and development agents are prevented from getting sufficient knowledge on pest management strategies and tactics.

MoANR and regional agricultural bureaus are loosely co nnected with the PHRD and the plant health clinics. The structure in the research system completely disregarded crop protection research and gave it the lowest possible emphases. The consequence of these was that the packages provided to development agents and farmers were incomplete and hence contributed to a number of regular pests to cause significant economic damage on the crops of their choices. As described above this has caused the un

significant economic damage on the crops of their choices. As described above this has caused the unregulated use of pesticides by farmers and the wider circulation of unhealthy planting materials, thus yield and quality of crops produced have been significantly compromised. There has been lack of comprehensive organizational setup for plant protection experts to feel comfortable in, an incentive mechanism rewarding th em to what they have been doing and to remain in their work position. The lac

mechanism rewarding th em to what they have been doing and to remain in their work position. The lack of recognition of their significance is expressed by the lower professional position at which crop protection experts have been assigned to work unlike their equals working in agronomy or crop production. Apparently there has been lack of proper awareness on the side of decision makers, at all levels, regarding the level of significance of conducting pest surveillance, survey, monitoring and con

erated pest management information, knowledge and skill sources for some economic pests Since the start of pest research at the then Alemaya College of Agriculture and the establishment of IAR in 1966 and later expansion of the National Agricultural Research System, much crop protection related research activities have been undertaken, and technologies have been generated. Some of the notewort hy achievements are the following: - Survey, collection, identification and documentation of pests of m

achievements are the following: - Survey, collection, identification and documentation of pests of major crops - Determination of yield loss for key pests of food and industrial crops - Chemical control studies against major economic pests - Cultural and physi cal control studies on major pests; - Host plant resistance studies. 29 Weakness es: 1. Policies and regulations : Although there is a proclamation on pesticide registration and control it has not been properly implemented due to lack of a

lamation on pesticide registration and control it has not been properly implemented due to lack of approved detailed regulation and directives. The quarantine regulation under enforcement has been approved in 1992. It is outdated an d needs significant updating such as the checklist of prohibited and restricted quarantine pests and also the conditions of entry of restricted plants, plant products and other regulated articles. Besides this domestic quarantine and post entry quarantine activities

and other regulated articles. Besides this domestic quarantine and post entry quarantine activities have not been established. This situation is further aggravated by the limited awareness of all stakeholders on the available policies and legislations in relation to the overall pest management . 2. National diagnostic and test laboratories : Natio nal and regional pest management laboratories are not providing sufficient pest identification, pesticide formulation and residue analyses, quarantine

not providing sufficient pest identification, pesticide formulation and residue analyses, quarantine services, and pest management services and test results like race analyses and bioassay. Some are nonexis tent and others poorly equipped, inadequately staffed and less coordinated. Most of the staffs don’t have the required knowledge and expertise to handle pest management related activities as needed. 3. Absence of national biosystematics institution for plan t pests and natural enemies : Havin

Absence of national biosystematics institution for plan t pests and natural enemies : Having biosystematics program in pest management is very significant because identification is the primary task in devising pest management strategy. Although the need to have such service is long overdue, there has not been a ny consolidated biosystematics services in the country particularly for insect pests, natural enemies and plant pathogens because there are no reference collections and taxonomic

lora of Ethiopia. 4. Failure to capac itate the PMSS : Because of the inadequate resources allocation for pest management support services and the organizational structure adopted to address pest management at all levels, pest management technologies generation dissemination has been affected s ignificantly. The competence of plant protection experts at zone, woreda and kebele levels are compromised due to mainly lack of need based trainings to experts and farmers on pest management and also the

ed due to mainly lack of need based trainings to experts and farmers on pest management and also the lack of staffs’ interest to pursue plant protection as a career. Moreover, because of the lower job title grades and insufficient remuneration assigned to the positions it was found difficult to retain experts in plant protection disciplines. Poor linkage and coordination between the federal MoANR and t he regional bureaus of agriculture in pest surveillance survey, monitoring and management of p

and t he regional bureaus of agriculture in pest surveillance survey, monitoring and management of pests has allowed the threat from pests to increase significantly. Moreover, due to the poor linkage between agricultural education, research, development and regu latory in plant pest management; problem identification, technology generation and dissemination has been hampered. Despite the significant benefit that can be gained by participating in plant protection national forums where current kno

nt benefit that can be gained by participating in plant protection national forums where current knowledge and techno logies in pest management are shared among professionals working at different levels, participation in such national forums including the PPSE annual conferences has been decreasing significantly. 5. Poor awareness creation : Although the level of awareness of the different stakeholders on the significance of pests and pest management varies it can be said that it has been genera

lders on the significance of pests and pest management varies it can be said that it has been generally low. There has been lower attention given to the promotion of pest management in the agriculture sector by decision makers at all levels. This has been expressed by the current organizational structure and manpower situation where few experts are placed in the extension directorate of each region and 30 are expected to coordinate the provision of pest m anagement related extension and regulato

n and 30 are expected to coordinate the provision of pest m anagement related extension and regulatory services in the respective regions at large. As a result of this multiple regular and quarantine pests have managed to cause significant economic damage on several crops. Although technology users and other commu nities have limited understanding regarding pests and pest management services, there exists wide gap between what they know and what should be exercised to mitigate the impacts of pes

e exists wide gap between what they know and what should be exercised to mitigate the impacts of pests, pesticides, and other technologies. 6. Clearly undefined pest managem ent support service for regular pests : The federal and regional governments provide pest management support service on regular pests. However, there is no clearly defined pest management support service for regular pests and the responsibilities of the two bodies in this regard are not articulated unambiguously. This has co

the responsibilities of the two bodies in this regard are not articulated unambiguously. This has contributed significantly to outbreaks of regular pests, which are causing significant economic damage and confusion in the handling of the outbreaks by different stakeholders. 7. Poor phytos anitary services and low focus on invasive alien species : Improvement in the direction of making the Phytosanitary service more effective in order to prevent the introduction of new pests into the country and

itary service more effective in order to prevent the introduction of new pests into the country and efficient to tackle emerging phytosanitary prob lems has not been made after the induction of the plant quarantine regulation and the termination of FAO funded institutional building project. Endeavour to direct the phytosanitary measures and procedures that are in use to the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures are very minimal. Phytosanitary procedures like pest risks analyses, post

on Phytosanitary Measures are very minimal. Phytosanitary procedures like pest risks analyses, post entry quarantine, regular surveillance, survey a nd emergency response on quarantine pests are not in practice. As a result of this quarantine pests have gained access into the country without being intercepted. Furthermore, lack of emergency response and eradication system to control alien invasive spec ies has caused introduced pests such as parthenium and prosopis to spread widely in the countr

 spec ies has caused introduced pests such as parthenium and prosopis to spread widely in the country. The management of established invasive alien species is not only the responsibility of the agricultural sector but also other sectors such as the construction sector, ministry of environment, forestry and climate change, municipalities etc.... 8. Information communication technologies use in pests management : There is lack of regular and systematic pest status documentation and economic pest a

ent. What are described above clearly show that the promotion of IPM is far below than the expectation attached to it by the lead institutions who want to see IPM promoted across the country in order to significantly reduce the use of synthetic organic pesticides. Some of the limiting factors that derailed the effective implementation of IPM include the lower focus on generating alternative pest control tactics and crop production enhancing technologies, lack of 31 post registration control of p

ontrol tactics and crop production enhancing technologies, lack of 31 post registration control of pesticides, shortage of information and knowledge on IPM. Users’ perception and appreciation of the effect of pesticide use is dominant over the use of other alternatives pest management practices and IPM. 10. Misuse and lack of tracking mechanism for pesticides : When pesticides are imported in bulk there is no confirmatory laboratory tests carried out. Due to the lack of effective pesticides trac

 there is no confirmatory laboratory tests carried out. Due to the lack of effective pesticides tracking mechanism, widespread mishandling of pesticides after import, during dis tribution and use has been routinely encountered. The distribution of pesticides by bulk importers, retailers and kiosks is not abided fully by the rules of safe handling of pesticides. There has been use of pesticides on pests/crops combinations other tha n for what they were registered for. Use of expired pesticides, a

pests/crops combinations other tha n for what they were registered for. Use of expired pesticides, application of pesticides at lower/higher doses than the recommended rates and frequencies are recorded experiences. Opportunities : 1. The expanding and growing information communication technologies use in the country : The pest information exchange particularly for migratory pests has been the use of fixed and mobile communication radio gadgets.

 of fixed and mobile communication radio gadgets. This has been replaced with wireless telephones and cell phones. Moreover, there are web based technologies that can be used for pest information exchange. These technologies have been considered as opportunities in the enhancement of pest management support service in Ethiopia. 2. The expansion of Universities : The presence of agriculture and related teaching Universities and colleges is considered as the main provider of trained manpower for i

ated teaching Universities and colleges is considered as the main provider of trained manpower for improved PMSS. Moreover, these teaching institutions are also mandated to do research on pests and pest management. Theref ore, the expansion is believed to be an opportune for furthering PMSS. 3.

It is possible to work in collaboration with these regional and global organizations to enhance PMSS. Threats : 1. Climate change Although climate change has been part of a natural process, due to the increased anthropogenic interference as a consequence of elevated CO 2 release in to the atmosphere, the global temperature has been raising.

 to the atmosphere, the global temperature has been raising. Both increase and decrease of rainfall are occurrences related to the changing climate, which affects the reproduction and behavior of pests. The change has been helping pests to incre ase their presence at levels they have not been able to reach at and are causing significant economic damage in agriculture. Unless adaptation and mitigation strategies are put in place to reduce threats from pest damage aggravated by climate change ther

ion strategies are put in place to reduce threats from pest damage aggravated by climate change there will be increasing economic losses in the sector due to pests’ damages. Therefore, having in place a responsive PMSS to the changing climate is important in order to minimize the effect of pests, which will be favored by the changing climate and enhance th e contribution of natural enemies in natural pest control. 2. Globalization and pest movement Globalization and the expedited movement of pla

ral pest control. 2. Globalization and pest movement Globalization and the expedited movement of plants, plant products and other regulated articles have increased the possibility for introduction of new pests to coun tries. It is possible to intercept some but not all incoming quarantine pests due to high volume and variety of commodities imported through various ports of entry. The actions we have been taking need to be expounded in order to cope with the high risk of pest introduction. This i

ve been taking need to be expounded in order to cope with the high risk of pest introduction. This is aggravated by the porous international borders of the country. Therefore we need to make our PMSS respond to this emerging scenario. 3. Pesticides related threats Emergence of resistant pests to pesticide is happening in the country. For instance diamond back moth to lambda cyhalothrin, bollworm in cotton to endosulfan, aphids to dimethoate and onion thrips to profenophos are some of the pestici

n cotton to endosulfan, aphids to dimethoate and onion thrips to profenophos are some of the pesticide resistances report ed in the country. The causes for resistance development include: increasing lack of alternative pesticides to mange economic pests and under/over use of available pesticides, presence of poorly informed, trained and skilled pesticide users and also the escalating price of new generation of pesticide. Moreover, lack of corporate -thinking and suppliers bias towards high profi

generation of pesticide. Moreover, lack of corporate -thinking and suppliers bias towards high profit than responding to growers demand such as the failure to supply new generation seed dressing pesticides has been a challenge. All the se have allowed illegal pesticide trade to proliferate and become threat to both for the growers and consumers. 4. Pesticide maximum residue limit The maximum residue levels set by individual countries varies significantly and is stringent. There has been intercep

ue levels set by individual countries varies significantly and is stringent. There has been interception of pesticide residues in coffee, sesame, and haricot beans beyond permissible levels. As a consequence of this a number of consignments have been rejected by a number of importing countries. This demands the PMSS to maintain a high standard pe sticide use and management to meet the desired international market quality requirements. 33 5.

rnational market quality requirements. 33 5. Migratory pests management and workplace security Lack of peace and security in recession areas of locusts in the neighboring countries like Eritrea, Somalia and Yemen has made close monitoring and early intervention migratory pests very difficult. For instance the 2014 desert locust outbreak that originated in Somaliland has managed to cross the highlands of Ethiopia including Addis Ababa, which was invaded after almost half a century. This was a res

nds of Ethiopia including Addis Ababa, which was invaded after almost half a century. This was a result of the failure by Somaliland to monitor and intervene early and communicate to Ethiopian counterparts working on desert locust monitoring and control. There has also been insecur ity in some woreda within South East Somali region of Ethiopia where desert locust traditionally breeds as it was witnessed during the 2007/8 desert locust outbreak. 6.

Education in pest management Graduate school level training in pest management began at the then Alemaya college of Agriculture in 1979 by enrolling competent plant science graduates. This attracted more post graduate students to join the discipline, which contributed a lot to the ful fillment of trained manpower in pest management profession in the country. But through time students interest to join pest management fields of study has decrease

the country. But through time students interest to join pest management fields of study has decreased significantly, which is expressed by the availability of opportunities to study other scienc e fields with high market demand such as medicine and engineering, which are attracting the best students. Moreover, there is a decline in the quality of education, graduates and theses in pest management. 3.5 Strategic/critical issues identified Followed a thorough analysis, the key strategic issues wer

Then the pest management support service had been provided by the plant protection and regulatory department, which was dichotomized as crop protection and plant quarantine divisions. Further the crop protection divi sion was subdivided into seven sections representing the major disciplines that should be addressed. The PMSS provision is currently organized, at the federal level, to be provided by three directorates, which are

he Indian structure gives significant emphases to IPM and has put it at equal footing with quarantine, pesticide regulation and migratory pest control. Therefore by critically evaluating the three countries organizational structures and the previous organogram from Ethiopia the team felt that separating the regulatory from the other services or putting them all under same organizational structure are possibilities. Therefore , by taking into consideration the other countries experiences, the pre

provision. Critical gaps were observed, which allowed the introduction and spread of this disease on the most strategic grain crop of the country, maize. The MLND is caused by viruses, which require molecular diagnosis to detect their presence in maize seed lots being introduced into the country and o n growing maize plants in the field. Because there was no laboratory that could provide such diagnostic service, and technical knowledge and expertise, the disease was introduced into the country a

nostic service, and technical knowledge and expertise, the disease was introduced into the country and spread quickly in the seed growers’ farms unnoticed. The problem was noticed after significant loss was sustained by maize seed growers. In 2014, some seed growers in the rift valley lost all their harvest due to the disease. It was realized that the maize seed growers use the emasculation technique to detasse l maize florets from the female parent instead of using male sterile lines when produ

que to detasse l maize florets from the female parent instead of using male sterile lines when producing hybrid seeds. While the laborers exercise this, they might have spread MLND causing viruses mechanically. This might have been the primary cause for the high disease incidence and significant seed losses sustained by many maize seed growers who have been working in the rift valley. Therefore, the causes for the introduction and spread of MLND could be attributed to gaps that existed at differ

In general if the PMSS had put the capabilities, responsibilities and accountabilities of all actors in the agriculture and other se ctors; and all the responsible bodies were facilitated well to perform their respective tasks, it should not have been that accessible for such devastating pests to set foot and spread in the country easily.

The entry into the country and spread could have been curbed if the following bodies could adequately fulfill the responsibilities indicated hereunder.

As they are, the processes are not well organized to respond to the current needs of farmers across the country on how to manage pests of economic importance. In general, the PMSS system in the national regions across the country is currently non-responsive to the needs of farmers due to the downsized manpower in crop protection and its consideration as one service in crops packages to be delivered by the extension directorate, the lower budget a

riculture and work with all the zones, woredas and FTCs in the regions. This should work both for pest management and plant quarantine services. The PHC s are also expected to provide technical support for the zonal bureaus of agricult ure in their respective national regions. The current number and location of PHCs is not sufficient to provide efficient PMSS across the country hence t he zonal bureaus are expected to provide regular support to all the woredas within them. In turn the wor eda of

reaus are expected to provide regular support to all the woredas within them. In turn the wor eda offices are expected to provide similar service to FTCs and farmers. The country does not have well developed pest information exchange system due to both lack of a system to promote the network and also lack of sufficient professionals who can conduc t pest identification services and provide feedback to the higher and parallel placed offices. Due to this the status of regular pests around the coun

k to the higher and parallel placed offices. Due to this the status of regular pests around the country at anyone season are not known fully, introduction and establishment of new pests go unnoticed and are intercepted only after they caused significant economic damage to different economic crops. Because of this we need to put in place pest information exchange network with efficien t feedback loops at all levels in the PMSS workflow . The organogram described below demonstrates that we need to

ops at all levels in the PMSS workflow . The organogram described below demonstrates that we need to have two ways of interaction at all levels so that pest information flow between all the actors in the PMSS could be fastened. The entire PMSS should continue to get significant support from the extension directorate of the MoANR in receiving 47 information on current pest problems; from NARS in ge tting technical support to man age pest problems; from higher learning institutions in developing t

ated fields has been declining significantly. Currently high calibre students are not showing interests to join agriculture fields and the situation is worse in plant protection. Therefore , the causes for this scenario need to be understood a nd solutions found in order to reinvigorate the PMSS of the country. 4.6.4 Implementation resource needs Although the government of Ethiopia is fully committed to reinvigorate the PMSS in the country, the resources being allocated may not be sufficient eno
