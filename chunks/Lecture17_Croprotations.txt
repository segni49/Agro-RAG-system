Crop rotation improves the physical and chemical condition s of soil and thus improves the overall fertility. Nitrogen-fixing legumes such as soybeans and alfalfa in cro p rotations fix atmospheric N2 into the soil through root nodules. This nitrogen is then available for subsequent cro ps. Deep rooted cover crops can draw up nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus from deep in the soil profile, potassium and phosphorus from deep in the soil profile, making these nutrients available for su

ile, potassium and phosphorus from deep in the soil profile, making these nutrients available for subsequent shallowrooted cash crops. Growing a hay crop in a rotation can result in improved tilth and bulk density. When a hay crop is ploughed in, the soil will be loose and have a good granular structure and tilth. These improved properties result from the soil being protected from raindrops, the network of fine roots in the soil, and the formation of humus from decomposing plant roots.DISEASE C

For such diseases, rotating a non-host crop immediately after a host crop prevents the pathogen from reproducing . prevents pathogen reproducing The pathogen inoculu

For example, soybean cyst nematode population s can be cut in half by rotating soybean with wheat and corn. In the absence of crop rotation, growing the same crop on a parti cular land year after year gives pathogens continued optimal condit ions, and their popul

lay in the with crop rotation .These insects lay eggs in the corn fields they live on, and emerge to damage subsequent crops. Rotating a non-host crop immediately after a corn crop means that emerging larvae starve due to scarcity of food. Note that this practice is ineffective in some areas where rootworm populations have developed mechanisms to survive crop rotation.WEED CONTROL Including cover crops into crop rotation systems provides greater competitions to the weeds for their basic needs s

 crops into crop rotation systems provides greater competitions to the weeds for their basic needs such as nutrients, space and light. Cover crops ultimately crowd out the weeds, slowing down weed growth and proliferation for reduced down weed growth and proliferation for areduced weed population in subsequent crops.INCREASED SOIL ORGANIC MATTER Crop rotation will add more crop residues, green manures and other plant debris to the soil. Crop rotation also requires less intensive tillage, which

anures and other plant debris to the soil. Crop rotation also requires less intensive tillage, which means that soil organic matter does not degrade as quickly. Increased soil organic matter improves soil infiltration and water holding capacity, which enables water to be absorbed into the soil.Furthermore, increased soil organic matter improves overall soil structure and the chemical and biological properties of the soil.EROSION CONTROL Crop rotation helps control the erosion of soil from wate

Crop rotation also supports reduced or no- till farming, which ensures even better protection against ero sion. Cover crops are effective in reducing raindrop impact, redu cing sediment detachment and transport, slowing surface runoff, and so transport, slowing runoff, reducing soil loss.

For examp le, rigid crop rotations give good crop growth along with effective soil cov er under consistent climatic conditions of fairly predictabl e annual rainfall and temperature.

In harnessing the benefits of crop rotation, the selection of crop should be such that preceding crop helps in making available nutrients to succeeding crops.SELECTING THE RIGHT CROPS FOR YOUR SYSTEM A successful crop rotation requires the selection of the rig ht crops for your farm .

They also draw up nutrients from deep in the soil profile, making them available for subsequent shallow rooted crops.

Legumes fix nitrogen in the soil, making it available for subsequent crops.

The crop rotation in organic farmi ng must provide the soil fertility required for maintaining productivity and it must prevent problems with weeds, pestsand diseases. This is obtained through a proper sequence of crops in time and space and through the use of N2fixing crops and cover and space and through the use
