T STATEMENT Soil degradation and fertility depletion in the cul- tivated land of Ethiopian highlands is severe due to mainly complete removal of crop residues, and abandoning of crop rotation and organic matter application. Consequently, crop productivity and its response to chemical fertilizers have been declining consistently. Researchers, extension workers and farmers, on the other hand, don’t realize well about these phenomena. Hence, a field experiment was conducted for three years in the c

At the expense of sound crop rotation practices and farm yard manure applications, the scale and extent of using these two NP chemical fertilizers for crop production have been indeed increased tremendously in the country especially in the highlands (Tamene et al., 2017 ).

Initially when the crop fields were containing sufficient soil organic matter, applications of NP chemical fertilizers to major cereal crops gave better yields to farmers, and thereby applications of NP chemical fertilizers have been passively accepted by Ethiopian farmers as better means of increasing soil productivity (Shibabaw et al., 2017 , 2018 ; Tamene et al., 2017 ).

On the contrary to increase the use of NP chemical fertilizers in the country, using sound crop rotation practices and farm yard manure applications, which had been adopted long as well-established nutrient and land management prac - tices undertaken by Ethiopian smallholder farmers for centuries have been abandoned gradually (Shibabaw et al., 2017 , 2018 ).

 ). Applications of NP chemical fertilizers to crop fields would not be considered as ill practice, indeed. But rather, their exclusive usage for long time without complementary applications of organic matter as that of being practiced currently by Ethiopian farmers results in aggravating soil erosion and degradation of physical, chemical and biological properties of soils (Shibabaw et al., 2018 , 2017 ), and declining of crop responses even to the applied NP chemical fertilizers (Tamene et al.,

Several research reports underline the importance of organic inputs including compost, farm - yard, and green manure in restoring problematic soils. According to Karazija et al.

(2015 ), farmyard manure (FYM) enables to modifying the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil of cultivated lands into the better ones which are of more suitable to crop production. Physically, it functions well in enhancing aggregation and stability, and thereby improving soil structure, porosity, and water-holding capacity, as well as, reducing soil bulk density (Mutegi, 2012 ).

In turn, stability of aggregates prevents surface sealing and soil erosion, improves water infiltration, and enhances water-holding capacity (Martínez et al., 2013 ). Soil porosity is important for root proliferation, gas exchange, and water retention and movement. Moreover, FYM improves the retention of plant nutrients and increases the soil biodiversity (Lal, 2009 ). The chemical properties of the soil are the second important c

Organic inputs also enhance cation exchange capacity (CEC) particularly in sandy soils and reduce Al toxicity and P-fixation in strongly acidic soils with oxide mineralogy (Negassa et al., 2007 ). Contrary to inorganic chemical fertilizers that supply only a few plant nutrients mainly NP in Ethiopian case, organic inputs constitute all essential plant mineral nutrients, although their available nutrient contents are low and they are released slowly.

To meet the large requirements of plants for macronutrients mainly NP with only organic inputs, application of huge quantity of organic inputs per unit area is hence required as compared to inorganic chemical fertilizers. Unless their sources are limited and their transportation and uniform application to crop fields are cumbersome, organic inputs can be used as fertilizers for enhancing the productivi

o crop fields are cumbersome, organic inputs can be used as fertilizers for enhancing the productivity of soils. According to Karazija et al. (2015 ), application of farmyard manure at 40 t/ha significantly increased the tuber yield of potato (40 t/ha) by four folds over the yield (10.5 t/ha) of unfertilized control. Similarly, Ali & Al- Juthery, 2015 reported that application of well-prepared organic fertilizer at the optimal rate of 20 t/ha gave an equivalent tuber yield of potato produced wit

anic fertilizer at the optimal rate of 20 t/ha gave an equivalent tuber yield of potato produced with 100% mineral fertilizers. In addition, Sayed et al. (2014 ) indicated that organic production of potato using 23.8 t/ha of compost could be an alternative to the conventional production with commercial inorganic fertilizers without significant reduction in yield and quality. Furthermore,; Zha et al. (2015 ) reported that long-term organic manure fertilization at the rate of 10 t/ha attributed to

l. (2015 ) reported that long-term organic manure fertilization at the rate of 10 t/ha attributed to elevating wheat grain yield to 4.58 t/ha as compared to 2.02 t/ha grain yield obtained from unfertilized control. Similarly, Der et al. (2012 ) showed that organic manure increased grain yield of wheat by 23.2% over that of unfertilized treatment. Besides, Muhammad and Anwar (2008 ) showed that application of organic manure increased the wheat yield by 105% over the control. All other growth para

lication of organic manure increased the wheat yield by 105% over the control. All other growth parameters such as plant height, number of tillers, spike length, straw yield, grain yield, and thousand grain weight of wheat grown after incorporation of manure into the soil were statistically different from that of the control (Muhammad & Anwar, 2008 ). Sound crop rotation plays also a great role in amending soil health and productivity. According to Eugenija et al. (2014 ), the greatest tuber yie

(2015 ) found that potato plants grown in plots following common vetch and faba bean produced 12.7% and 15.0% more tuber yield, respectively, over that of potato grown after winter wheat. Stefano et al. (2010 ) indicated that clover green manure and farmyard manure substan - tially increased the total yield of

indicated that clover green manure and farmyard manure substan - tially increased the total yield of potato by 22.5% and 25.1%, respectively, over the untreated control. In addition, the effect of including legume in the rotation system on improving wheat yield is quite tremendous. According to Talgre et al. (2009 ), the yield of spring wheat on wheat to wheat rotation system was only 2.12 t/ha but an extra yield of 1.45 t/ha was recorded after Lucerne as a preceding crop. Similarly, Garofalo et

t an extra yield of 1.45 t/ha was recorded after Lucerne as a preceding crop. Similarly, Garofalo et al. (2009 ) reported that the yield increment of wheat following faba bean was above 12% but this effect went up to 135% in drier years. In line with these reports, Ndayegamiye et al. (2015 ) demonstrated that legumes have significantly increased yields of wheat by 35%. Ali et al. (2015 ) showed that legumes as preceding crop had significantly elevated grain yield (5.1 t/ha) compared to wheat-whe

at legumes as preceding crop had significantly elevated grain yield (5.1 t/ha) compared to wheat-wheat (3.18 t/ha) cropping systems. Furthermore, Hayat and Ali (2010 ) demonstrated that legumes certainly increased the biomass and grain yield of succeeding wheat by 18% over nonlegume sorghum. Agronomists and soil fertility scientists strongly advise to use inorganic chemical fertilizers with the integration of organic matter applications (Tamene et al., 2017 ). On top of its great role in improvi

tegration of organic matter applications (Tamene et al., 2017 ). On top of its great role in improving physical, chemical and biological properties of soils, the presence of sufficient organic matter in the soil enhances not only the uptake efficiency of the applied chemical fertilizers by crop plants, but it also increases also the response of crops productivity to the applied chemical fertilizers (Tamene et al., 2017 ).

During application of NP chemical fertilizers, the presence of sufficient organic matter in the soil is essential for supplying of the remaining essential mineral nutrients to the growing crop plants at required levels through its mineralization. As indicated above, application of NP chemical fertilizers alone for long without applying organic inputs would eventually be ended up with the declining of crops productivity responses to the applied NP chemical fertilizers (T

 the growing crop plants. Soil degradation is one of the main causes of increasing food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia (FAO, 2015 ). This is often due to continuous cultivation, a low replenishing rate of organic matter, mono-cropping, and ineffective use of mineral fertilizer (FAO, 2015 ). For the Ethiopian highlands, Meseret et al. (2015 ) showed that continuous cultivation leads to nutrient depletion, high bulk density, low soil pH, and reduced soil organic carbon. Habtam

(2014 ) confirmed that over- relying on chemical soil fertilizer and continuous cropping negatively impacted the physico-chemical properties of cultivated soil that is in turn resulting in low levels of N, P, S, cation exchange rate (CEC), and soil porosity. Yihnew (2015 ) reported low levels of soil pH, nitrogen, and available phosphorus in the highlands of Awi Zone. He reported also cri

He reported also critically low levels of nitrogen, organic matter, CEC, and available phosphorus in most cropping areas of northwest Ethiopia. Meanwhile, multiple organic matter sources are wildly available in the highlands of Awi Zone, northwest Ethiopia (Shibabaw et al., 2017 , 2018 ).

Crop residues and shrubs of green manure (tree lucerne, clover, and sesbania) are also found in a measurable amount (Shibabaw et al., 2017 , 2018 ). As indicated above, however, farmers have abandoned to apply these organic materials to their crop soils since they started to use NP commercial chemical fertilizers (Shibabaw et al., 2017 , 2018 ).

Furthermore, contin - uous cereal cropping systems are dominating in the area without integration of legume crops in the rotation system (Shibabaw et al., 2017 , 2018 ).Abandoning of using sound crop rotation practices and organic inputs in the crop farms of Ethiopian highlands has been resulting in deteriorating the physicochemical properties of cultivated lands and their productivity (Shibabaw et al., 2017 , 2018 ).

Hence, there is an urgent need for redirecting the current trends of inorganic soil fertility management systems to integrated organic and inorganic soil fertility management systems in the crop farms of northwest Ethiopian highlands.

e soils of experimental sites were low in organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorous, and exchangeable potassium contents with moderately acidic pH and moderate CEC (Table 2). Their bulk density was also compacted with 1.37 gcm−3. Similar to the present results, Yihnew (2015 ), Shibabaw et al. (2017 , 2018 ) reported also low soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorous contents in the crop fields of Awi Zone in northwest Ethiopian highlands. Slightly different from

Slightly different from the present results, Yihnew (2015 ) reported even low levels of soil pH and CEC in the present study area. High bulk density and low levels of most chemical properties of experimental soils verified the severity of soil degradation in the crop farms of northwest Ethiopian highlands that would likely be associated with improper soil man - agement (Habtamu et al., 2014 ).

the lowest improvements were observed with the rotation of bread wheat undersowing lupine–potato undersowing lupine– bread wheat (R4). With different crop rotations, lesser improvements of 10.04–15.15% and 9.36– 12.60% were relatively recorded in bulk density and pH, respectively (Table 4). On the other hand, higher improvements of 50.00–89.58%, 53.30–69.44%, 36.71–63.29% and 35.79–48.59% were observed in total nitrogen (TN), avaialble phosphorous (AP) and organic carbon (OC) contents, and CEC,

The improving effects of crop rotations on soil TN, AP, OC, CEC and K+ were shown in similar trends of R1 > R2 > R3 > R5 > R4 (Table 4) and these might be related to their differences in kind and amount of crop residues and/ or legume green manure that were incorporated into the soil in the first and second cropping years. In harmony to t

In harmony to the present results, several researchers reported that integrating crop rotation with legume crops improved most soil properties much better than monocroppings (Meseret et al., 2015 ; Muthoni & Kabira, 2010 ; Perez et al., 2013 ; Yusuf et al., 2009 ). The impact of manure treatments on the improvement of soil properties was more distinctive than that of crop rotations. Average percentile improvemen

The highest improvements in all soil properties were recorded with the application of 2.5 ton ha−1 sesbania green manure + 5 ton ha−1 fresh cattle manure (M4), while the lowest improvements were recorded with the control without manure application (M1).

The control without manure application rendered even to improve BD, pH, CEC, OC, TN, AP, and EK of experimental soils by 5.99%, 5.25, 25.68%, 20.32%, 20.00%, 36.37%, and 7.35%, respectively.

Their contribution was not only limited to the control without manure application (M1), they were also complementing other manure treatments (M2, M3, and M4) to have more impact on the improvement of soil properties.

Grain productivity of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) Grain yield productivity of bread wheat was highly significantly (P < 0.001) affected by crop rotations and manure treatments, and by their interactions (Figures 2–4).

Main and interaction effects of crop rotations and manure treatments on the productivity of bread wheat increased in ascending order from the first cropping year (2013) to the second (2014) and the third (2015) cropping years. After three years from 2013 to 2015, interaction of R4 with M1, M2, M3, and M4 attributed to increase grain yield of bread wheat by 65%, 112%, 139%, and 116%, respectively (Figure 2). Such significant increment of grain yield of bread wheat with the same treatment

ctively (Figure 2). Such significant increment of grain yield of bread wheat with the same treatments in the succeeding cropping years would likely be associated with the cumulative direct and residual effects of the applied manure treatments, and crop residues and legume green manure incorporated into the soil in the first and second cropping years. Across all three years, grain yield of bread wheat in different crop rotation systems increased with the increase of manure rates (Figure 2). In th

eat in different crop rotation systems increased with the increase of manure rates (Figure 2). In the first cropping year (2013), the interaction of R4 with manure treatments gave better grain yield of bread wheat than the interaction of R1 with manure treatments. In the third cropping year (2015), the interaction of R3 with manure treatments gave the highest grain yield of bread wheat ascompared to the interactions of R5 and R4 with manure treatments (Figure 2).

The highest grain yield of bread wheat (4.48 t ha−1) was recorded in 2015 with the interaction of R3 and M4 followed by the interaction of R5 and M4 (3.88 t ha−1). Similarly, the response of grain yield of bread wheat to the control without manure application in potato–clover– bread wheat rotation (R3) was better than in lupine–potato undersowing lupine–bread wheat rotation (R5), and bread wheat undersowing lupine–potato underso

Although they didn’t see the interaction effect of crop rotation and manure/copost application on wheat productivity, in agreement with the present results, several researchers observed also signifi - cant improvement of wheat productivity after the rotation of legume crops (Ali et al., 2015 ; Babulicova, 2016 ; Garofalo et al., 2009 ; Hayat & Ali, 2010 ; Nda

Besides, the differences between crop rotations for grain yield productivity of bread wheat became distinct as the progress of the cropping years. In the first cropping year (2013), there was no significant (P ≥ 0.05) difference between R1 and R4 for grain yield of bread wheat. As compared to that of R4 and R1 in 2013, however, grain yield of bread wheat leaped by 94%–115% in 2014 with R2. This signif

This significant increment in 2014 with R2 was largely due to clover green manure incorporated in the first cropping year. The maximum grain yield of bread wheat (3.15 t ha−1) in 2015 was recorded with R3, which was higher than that of R1 in 2013 by 176% (Figure 3). Differences between R3, R4, and R5 for grain yield productivity of bread wheat in 2015 might largely due to their differences in kind and amount

 yield productivity of bread wheat in 2015 might largely due to their differences in kind and amount of crop residues and legume green manure incorporated into soil in the first and second cropping years. In line with the present results, Zaghloul (2010 ) reported that organic residues resulted in increasing the grain productivity of wheat signifi - cantly. Several workers observed also significantly higher grain yields of wheat after the pre- ceding of legume crops than that of cereal crops (Al

Similar to that of crop rotations, effect of manure treatments on productivity of bread wheat grain was increased also very significantly with the progress of the cropping years from 2013 to 2014 and 2015 (Figure 4).

Grain yield productivity of bread wheat in 2014 with M4 was also similar with that of M3 in 2015. These results clearly indicated that incorporation of crop residues and legume green manure into the soil in the preceding cropping seasons had comparable effect on bread wheat productivity as that of newly applied manure treatments in some extent.

Marked increment of bread wheat productivity with manure treatments in the progress of the cropping years revealed noticeably that applied manure as treatments, and crop residues and legume green manure incor - porated into the soil in the preceding cropping seasons had significant residual additive effect on boosting grain productivity of bread wheat with newly applied manure treatments.

(2014 ) reported that organic manures and biofertilizers had substantial direct, residual, and cumulative effects on improving grain yield productivity and quality of wheat. Moharana et al. (2012 ) and Zha et al. (2015 ) reported also that long-term applications of organic manures attributed to increase the grain productivity of wheat steadily year after year.

Tuber productivity of potato (Solanum tubersum) Similar to that of bread wheat, main and interaction effects of crop rotations and manure applications on the productivity of potato tuber yield increased more significantly with the progress of the cropping seasons than their differences between treatments within the same cropping year (Figures 5–7). Productivity of potato tuber yield across

n treatments within the same cropping year (Figures 5–7). Productivity of potato tuber yield across the interaction of crop rotations and manure treatments increased significantly over rotation phases (Figure 5). It was increased with the increase of manure in the same rotation system, but its peak increment with the maximum manure treatment in one rotation system switched down back bottom in the control without manure application in another rotation system (Figure 5). As compared to the interac

control without manure application in another rotation system (Figure 5). As compared to the interaction of R3 with the highest manure level (M4) in 2013, the interaction of R5 and R1 with M4 in 2014 and 2015 attributed to increase the productivity of potato tuber yield by 70% and 141%, respectively. Similarly, the interaction of R1 and R5 with the control without manure application (M1) in 2014 and 2015 attributed to increase the productivity of potato tuber yield by 100% and 179%, respectively

nd 2015 attributed to increase the productivity of potato tuber yield by 100% and 179%, respectively, compared to that of R3 interaction with M1 in 2013. In 2014, the interaction effect of R4 with manure treatments on potato productivity was similar to that of R5 interaction with manure treatments. In 2015, responses of potato productivity to the interaction of R1 with M1 and M4 were significantly different from that of R2 interaction with M1 and M4 (Figure 5). Steadily increase of tuber yield p

Steadily increase of tuber yield productivity of potato over years would likely be associated with residual and cumulative effects of manure and crop residues. In harmony with the present results, Manoj et al. (2013 ) showed that long-term organic treatments either Figure 5.

(2010 ) reported also that tuber yield of potato was significantly increased year after year through applications of composted dairy manure and proper crop rotation system. Similar to that of the interaction between crop rotation and manure application, improving effect of crop rotations on the productivity of potato tuber yield was also pronounced much with the progress of the cropping years from 2013 to 2015 (Figure 6). The

The highest potato tuber yield of 23.91 t ha−1 was recorded in the third experimental year of 2015 from bread wheat–clover– potato rotation system (R1), while the lowest potato tuber yield of 10.32 t ha−1 was recorded in the first experimental year of 2013 from potato–clover–bread wheat rotation system (R3).

As compared to that of 2013, similarly, the response of potato productivity to the control without manure application (M1) in 2014 and in 2015 increased by 97% and 158%, respectively.
