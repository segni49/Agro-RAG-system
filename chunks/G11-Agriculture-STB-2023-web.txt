Common Terms Used in Crop Production 1.2. Agriculture is defined as the deliberate cultivation of crops and rearing of animals. Before the introduction of agriculture, societies survived by hunting animals and gathering plants for food. Studies indicate that hunter-gatherers had to be insightful in order to survive. Today, hunting animals and gathering plants for food may be viewed as primitive and unskilled activities. However, the hunter-gatherer life-style has not completely disappeared with

d unskilled activities. However, the hunter-gatherer life-style has not completely disappeared with the expansion of agriculture. Even today, there are hunter-gatherers in areas where the land and climate conditions do not favour deliberate crop culture. Desert areas, Arctic region and pockets of tropical rain forest are examples of such places. Agriculture involves the deliberate cultivation of crops and the rearing of animals. Before development of agriculture, people started to domesticate an

rops and the rearing of animals. Before development of agriculture, people started to domesticate animals mainly for food production. Later, people started to breed animals in order to produce non-food materials. Crop and livestock production has gradually become the major means of survival for societies. Shifting cultivation: is a form of agriculture in which an area of ground is cleared of vegetation and cultivated for a few years and then abandoned for a new area. Early crop production involv

ation and cultivated for a few years and then abandoned for a new area. Early crop production involved temporary cultivation of land called shifting cultivation. This required clearing trees and cultivating the land for just one or two seasons. Abandoning the land cultivated after it had been cultivated once and shifting to a new location was common.

ed without requiring the application of scientific knowledge. Settled agriculture: the practice of using the same plot of land continuously over a long period to grow crops or rear livestock. In a settled agriculture, the land is cultivated continuously. The cultivation of land in a settled agriculture involves the use of yield enhancing practices. Crop management practices such as using manure, fertilizer, the construction of soil bunds for erosion control, and the optimized use of water have n

ertilizer, the construction of soil bunds for erosion control, and the optimized use of water have now become associated with cultivation of land in a settled agriculture. This means that a settled agriculture is a more advanced activity than traditional shifting cultivation.

plus for trade. Subsistence farming refers to a situation in which a farmer produces crops and livestock sufficient only for household use without any surplus for trade. The major aim of this type of farming is to produce crops and animals for the farmer’s own consumption. Subsistence farming often requires simple techniques that often do not go beyond a household capacity. If there is any excess production, it might be stored for times of poor harvest or sold to generate income for the househol

production, it might be stored for times of poor harvest or sold to generate income for the household. 1.2. The Origin of Domesticated Crops It is not possible to know the exact place and time that agriculture began. However, growing crops and rearing animals in a specific area is a deliberate activity that took a long time to develop. Evolution of agricultural economies transformed wild plant species to the fully domesticated ones. It is possible that religion may have influenced agriculture as

cies to the fully domesticated ones. It is possible that religion may have influenced agriculture as particular animals and plants were kept as they were required for religious practices. There may be many reasons why the hunter-gatherer culture gradually changed to agriculture and this change took place over thousands of years. No strong evidence is available on how hunter-gatherers chose their food sources. A fair estimate could perhaps be that the hunter-gatherers were influenced by certain f

ood sources. A fair estimate could perhaps be that the hunter-gatherers were influenced by certain features of the plant species they selected as food sources. This selection as food source probably influenced Agriculture Grade 11 Introduction to Crop Production 4the domestication process of the plant species. Ease of harvest, wide availability and ease of transport to the desired place could have been some useful features hunter-gatherers considered in their plant selection. Plants selected for

Possessing climatic tolerance, having good flavour and suitable grain size could also have been other desirable characteristics of plants considered for selection. The wild plant species that hunter-gatherers consumed include wild rice, grass species, wild oats and legumes. Legumes used by hunter gathere

ers consumed include wild rice, grass species, wild oats and legumes. Legumes used by hunter gatherers are known to have been toxic. This suggests that the societies detoxified and used the legumes as food. Their detoxifying skills were based on trial and error. Presumably, they used the poisonous substances they extracted from such toxic legumes as poisons on arrowheads in hunting. This discovery may suggest that in hunter-gatherer life style survival required insight. Root crops were widely us

 may suggest that in hunter-gatherer life style survival required insight. Root crops were widely used as food by hunter-gatherers particularly in the tropical region. Wild onions and sweet potatoes were also important food sources for hunter-gatherers. Hunter-gatherers used hunted animals and plant species such as coconut, oil palm and olive as sources of oil.

 Agriculture involves selection of a crop species, selection of specific types of crop and land preparation before planting. It also involved planting at the right time, protecting the crop from diseases and pests and adopting techniques to increase productivity.

This enables an individual farmer to operate a large farm. Agriculture in industrialized regions is often classified into three Eras: Mechanical Era (1930 - 1950) Chemical Era (1950 - 1970) and Biotechnology/Information Technology Era (1970 - present) Agricultural productivity in industrialized regions has increased as a result of the use of indu

Five major crops constitute approximately 75% of the country’s cultivated area: teff wheat maize sorghum and barley These grain crops supply approximately 64% of the calories consumed in the country. Cereals are grasses cultivated for their grains. Table 1.1 shows the increase in production of cereals (million tons) from 1961 to 2019.

This can be associated mainly with the expansion of cultivated area as shown in table 1.1 and to some extent, increased use of agricultural inputs. However, there is limited evidence to support a parallel increase in productivity per unit area cultivated. The yield level is mainly limited by the recurrent droughts and climate changes.

C4 plants have a mechanism to accumulate CO2 inside the chloroplast and therefore their photosynthetic rates do not increase with an increase in CO2 levels. This means that C4 plants can reach higher photosynthetic rates at low levels of CO 2 while C3 plants cannot. This is because C3 plants do not possess a CO2 accumulation mechanism.

There are several forms of cropping systems, including mono cropping, mixed cropping (including intercropping and relay planting) relay planting and crop rotation. 1.5.1. Mono cropping Mono cropping is growing a single crop type in a given plot of land. Mono cropping is commonly practiced in large scale commercial crop production. Some smallholder crop production systems may also practice mono cropping.

mmercial crop production. Some smallholder crop production systems may also practice mono cropping. In this system, a single crop species occupies the whole farm. One disadvantage of mono cropping is the risk of total crop failure, as a result of crop pests and diseases. Mono cropping also results in reduced soil fertility. On the other hand, mono cropping has the advantage that it enables farmers to use uniform management and increases the efficiency of practices like planting and harvesting. 1

 to use uniform management and increases the efficiency of practices like planting and harvesting. 1.5.2. Mixed cropping Mixed cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land. Mixed cropping reduces the risk of total yield loss as the farmer is not dependent on the yield of only one crop. Mixed cropping also allows for more efficient use of soil nutrients, water and light radiation. In addition, mixed cropping helps to break the cycle of crop pests and diseases whi

Intercropping Relay planting Relay planting is where a second crop is planted after the first crop has grown alone for a certain period. This system reduces the risk of total crop failure as the farmer doesn’t depend on the yield of one crop only. 1.5.3. Crop rotation Crop rotation is the practice of growing different crop species on

For example, planting maize in the first season can be followed by bean production in the next season, and cultivation of teff in the third season. The sequence might be repeated many times. Rotations could also involve more crop species depending on the environment. The objectives in crop rotation include improving soil fertility, especially if legumes are incl

n are also used to produce animal feed. The crop is adapted to semi-arid, lowland areas with an altitude of up to 1200 meters above sea level. This is mainly because it requires relatively high temperatures (25 to 27 OC) during the growing season. Sesame is very sensitive to excess water and though generally drought-tolerant, it is sensitive to extreme shortages of water. High rainfall during flowering reduces yield because flowers drop off the plant. Sandy loam soils that do not accumulate exce

Land preparation and planting: sesame is sensitive to weed problems and therefore the fields should be clean from weed seeds during land preparation. Since the seeds are small, soils should be free of big clods and the seedbed should be as smooth and clean as possible. Sesame is often planted by broadcasting or row planting at a spacing of 50 c

 yield for sesame is 7.4 quintals (0.74 t) per hectare. 3.1.2. Noug (Guizotia abyssinica L.) Noug is an oil crop that originated in Ethiopia. The country is the largest producer of noug. It is mainly produced for its oil and it accounts for about half of all food oil production in the country so it is an important source of good quality food oil. Noug oil can also be used for the production of paints and soaps. Residual material left after the oil is extracted is used as a source of animal feed.

oils that often accumulate excess water. Land preparation and planting: the seedbed needs to be well prepared to make sure that sown seeds germinate well. Noug is commonly sown by broadcasting. Alternatively, it can be planted at a spacing of 25 cm between rows and drilling of seeds within the planting rows at a depth of about 2cm. The crop is usually planted in June or July.

crop requires at least one weeding at early growth stage, but as it grows, it becomes very competitive against weeds, it can even dominate them. However, noug can be affected by parasitic weeds like dodder and orobanche. These weeds have to be uprooted and burned before they start producing seeds. If they are allowed to produce seeds, they will spread through the farms and the yield loss will be very high.

 for cooking and industrial purposes. 3.2.1. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) Cotton is a fiber crop that produces lint, which is a soft fluffy fiber that grows in a ball (protective case) around the seed. The lint is used as raw material in the textile industry. Cotton requires a warm climate to grow and is generally drought-tolerant. It does not perform in areas with high rainfall because the lint in the cotton boll will become discolored. This will reduce the quality of the yield. Loam soils ar

rial for textile firms. There were more than 50 garment or cloth manufacturers, and 14 textile factories in Ethiopia in 2021. The numbers of textile manufacturers, both local and international, are increasing and hence the demand for cotton is increasing. The contribution of the textile industry to foreign currency earning is growing. The supply of cotton to the textile industry from within Ethiopia is not sufficient to meet the demand. That is why textile manufacturers import raw cotton from ot

ia is not sufficient to meet the demand. That is why textile manufacturers import raw cotton from other countries. In order to meet the demand of the local textile industry, it will be necessary to increase the production of cotton in the country. Land preparation and planting: cotton seeds for planting are usually treated with acid to remove the hairs on the seed. The crop is often planted in rows at a spacing of 1 m between rows and 30 cm between plants. The seed sowing depth is about 8 cm. We

s at a spacing of 1 m between rows and 30 cm between plants. The seed sowing depth is about 8 cm. Weed and insect pest management: weeds are one the major problems that limit cotton production in Ethiopia. Starting with a clean seedbed before planting can reduce this problem. Manual weeding at least twice within one month after the weeds begin to emerge is recommended. Chemicals are also used to control weeds in cotton farms. Harvesting: cotton is ready for harvest when at least half of the plan

ontrol weeds in cotton farms. Harvesting: cotton is ready for harvest when at least half of the plants have their bolls burst open. Cotton requires 6 to 7 months to mature. After harvest (picking), cotton goes through different stages before it is used to make clothes. The first step in cotton processing is drying and ginning of the cotton from the cotton plant. Ginning is the process of separating seeds and plant debris from the cotton fiber. Then the cotton fibers are cleaned for dust and othe

g seeds and plant debris from the cotton fiber. Then the cotton fibers are cleaned for dust and other impurities. Once the cotton fibers are cleaned, they are transported to textile mills where spinning takes place to twist the raw cotton fibers into a thread. This is followed by weaving the thread into fabric or cloth. There were more than 35 mills producing fabrics (woven and knitted clothes) for the export Agriculture Grade 11 Industrial Crops Production and Management 41and domestic market i

Sisal (Agave sisalana L.) Sisal is a fiber crop believed to have originated in Central America. It is widely cultivated in the tropics. Sisal is mainly produced for its hard fibers that are used in textile industry for the production of ropes, sacks and carpets. Sisal fibers are also used in paper making and in the textile

roduction of ropes, sacks and carpets. Sisal fibers are also used in paper making and in the textile industry for polishing clothes. Sisal stem is also used for fencing, fire wood and as a house construction material. Sisal fiber is derived from the leaf of the plant. The plant is drought-resistant and can be grown as a rain-fed crop. This means that it can be grown using only rainfall for water and no other irrigation is required. Sisal can grow in a wide range of altitudes from sea level up to

nd no other irrigation is required. Sisal can grow in a wide range of altitudes from sea level up to 1800 meters above sea level. Land preparation and planting: sisal is propagated vegetatively. This means that a new plant will grow from the cutting of the parent plant. In sisal reproduction occurs through suckers growing around the plant or bulbils (young produced from buds in the flower stalk). The suckers or bulbils are first grown in a nursery. When they are about 40 cm high, they will be tr

The suckers or bulbils are first grown in a nursery. When they are about 40 cm high, they will be transplanted to the field. Often row planting is used at a spacing of 2.5 m between rows and 80 cm between plants. Harvesting: it takes 2 to 3 years after transplanting for the first harvest of leaves. After that, leaves can be harvested annually. Leaves are ready for harvest when they reach a height of 1.2 m and width of about 15 cm. After harvest, sisal leaves are scraped manually or using machine

of 1.2 m and width of about 15 cm. After harvest, sisal leaves are scraped manually or using machinery to separate the fibers from the leaf. This process is called decortication. The fiber is then washed and dried. The dried fiber is mechanically brushed to straighten Agriculture Grade 11 Industrial Crops Production and Management 42tangled and wavy fibers. The next step is grading of the fibers according to length and color. Packing for market is the last step in fiber processing. Figure 3.3. a

 as animal feed. The dark liquid produced from sugar cane juice is called molasses. Molasses is used in the production of ethanol. The fibrous residue left after the extraction of the juice is called Bagasse. It is used in the production of papers and plastics. It can also be used as firewood. The green top (leaf) of the plant is directly used as animal feed. The sugar cane crop takes from 14 to 18 months between planting and first harvest. After the first harvest, the plant regenerates from the

8 months between planting and first harvest. After the first harvest, the plant regenerates from the roots of the first harvest and is ready for harvest in about 12 months. The second harvest is usually called ratoon crop. Ratoon crop harvests are smaller than the first harvest. Ratoon harvests are limited to 2 or 3 times after the first planting. When ratoon harvests are over, new sugar cane plants are planted on the field. The sugar cane plant usually requires fertile soils. If grown on Agricu

The rumen and the reticulum are connected and work in concert and are therefore sometimes called the “reticulorumen”. Omasum is the third chamber of the ruminant stomach. It is situated between the reticulum and the abomasum. The omasum also helps digest feed and squeezes water from the feed. It is called “many plies” because it has many folds. Abomasum in ruminants is the fourth compartment of a ruminant’s stomach. The abomasum is a

rces available in Ethiopia are natural pastures, crop residues, improved forages and agro-industrial by-products. These are described below. 5.1.1. Natural Pasture Natural pastures are naturally occurring grasses, shrubs and tree forages (edible portions of plants). In natural pasture, forages grow naturally on their own and are feed upon by farm animals. Natural pastures usually provide more than 60% of livestock feed. Grazing is the least expensive way to deliver feed to animals. Natural pastu

ion of fertilizers (e.g., urea and DAP) in the pasture ensures rapid and succulent growth of pasture because of increase in the fertility of the soil. Weeds, pests and diseases should be prevented to ensure rapid growth of pasture crops. The correct number of animals should be placed on a pasture to graze. Overgrazing does not ensure increased productivity of pasture. 5.1.2. Crop Residues Crop residues are the remaining portion of the crops after harvesting the main crop for human consumption. S

idues are the remaining portion of the crops after harvesting the main crop for human consumption. Several forms of crop residues provide the majority (greater volume) of livestock feed. These include straws, stovers, cobs, hulls, chaffs, etc. Crop residues are generally low in crude protein, energy and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). They are fibrous and of low palatability and digestibility. Supplementing them with improved forages (forage legumes and browse species), grains and other

ity. Supplementing them with improved forages (forage legumes and browse species), grains and other concentrates is often recommended to maximize animal productivity. Their quality can also be improved by physically (e.g., chopping) or chemical methods such as treating with ordinary urea fertilizer. Crop residues generally are not suitable for pig and poultry feeding. Figure 5.2. Examples of crop residues: a) wheat stubble, b) millet straw , c) maize stover, d) barley straw, e) teff straw Agricu

Forage Crops Forage crops are plants cultivated for their edible vegetative portions and used in fresh or preserved forms of feeding livestock. There are two basic types of forage crops. These are grasses and legumes. Grasses serve as the best and cheapest bulk feed for ruminants. Grasses produce more yield per unit area than legumes. Gras

Rhodes grass, Sudan grass and Elephant grass are some examples of grasses used as animal feed. Legumes contain protein, vitamins and minerals than grasses. Legumes are usually used as a cheap source of supplement when feeding crop residues and natural pastures, for improved productivity of animals. Examples of legumes used for feed are Alfalfa, Vetch and Sesba

for improved productivity of animals. Examples of legumes used for feed are Alfalfa, Vetch and Sesbania sesban. The nutritive value and digestibility of forage crops generally declines as they mature. Cultivated forage crops can be cut and fed fresh or they can be conserved for the dry season. Farmers should be encouraged to produce improved forages in order to increase animal productivity. Figure 5.3.

Agro-industrial By-products These feed resources are by-products obtained from various agro- industries. They usually supplement crop residues such as straw. The commonly used agro-industrial by-products are flour milling by-products, oil seed cakes, molasses and brewery by-products. They are rich either in energy or protein, compared to pastures and crop residues.  Flour milling by-products:

Wheat bran, wheat middling and rice bran are some examples of milling by-products used as animal feed. Brans are pleasant-tasting feed to animals. They are also laxative animal feed. They can be used to supplement low quality feeds such as crop residues. Brans are especially good sources of thiamine and niacin vi

low quality feeds such as crop residues. Brans are especially good sources of thiamine and niacin vitamins. They supply fair amounts of protein and energy. Cereal middlings and rice polish are lower in fiber and higher in energy than brans. Forage production can be an attractive business Several new reforms have been implemented to encourage new business ideas in Ethiopia. Also, a lot of emphasis is being placed on animal farming. Forage production is a profitable business idea because feed shor

stock. The method is used to calculate the portion of two feeds needed to meet either the protein or energy requirements of an animal. To make this tool work, one of the feeds used must be higher in Metabolisable energy (ME) or CP than the desired level and the other feed must be below the desired level.The following steps show how to calculate for CP using the Pearson Square method. Step 1: Draw a square. Insert the % of CP desired in the final ration in the middle of the square. Step 2: Place

a square. Insert the % of CP desired in the final ration in the middle of the square. Step 2: Place the name of the first feed and its % of CP in the upper left corner. Place the name of the second feed and its % of CP in the lower left corner. Step 3: Subtract the desired % of CP (middle of the square) from the feed CP % (on the left of the square) across the diagonal and add the results to the right side of the square. • top left – middle = bottom right • bottom left – middle = top right Note:

Genetic improvement is based on the principle that the products (such as milk, meat, and wool) and services (e.g., transport, draught power or cultural services) provided by animals are functions of their genes and their living environment. There are three methods of genetic improvement applied in farm animals. These are breed introduction, selection and breeding. 6.2.1. Breed Introduction Breed introduction is br

High-quality breeds of livestock have a high productive capacity and other desirable characteristics. The introduction of high-quality breeds of livestock can be from another farm or another country. Before introducing such animals from another farm/country, it is important to be sure that the breeds possess higher quality charact

from another farm/country, it is important to be sure that the breeds possess higher quality characteristics than the local ones. There are different breeds of farm animals around the world. These are the local breeds, exotic breeds and the cross breeds. In Ethiopia, local breeds are usually small animals. They mature slowly and are poor producers. They are, however, adapted to the local environment and are resistant to diseases. Exotic breeds are breed that are not native to Ethiopia, and these

nt and are resistant to diseases. Exotic breeds are breed that are not native to Ethiopia, and these are often larger animals. They also mature early. They are good producers but they may not adapt to the local environment and fall victim to various diseases. To overcome these issues, the exotic breeds can be mated with the local breeds. This may help to obtain cross-breeds which possess the most desirable qualities of both exotic and local breeds. Advantages of breed introduction Characteristi

Selection Genetic improvement can be achieved by a proper selection. Selection is used as a tool for livestock improvement. Selection is the process of allowing genetically superior animals to be parents of future generations while culling others. Culling is the removal of animals which do not perform at the desired level,

s while culling others. Culling is the removal of animals which do not perform at the desired level, from the herd. The animals retained have certain desirable characteristics which make them more productive. Animals with desirable characteristics are selected. Selected animals make up the breeding stock. The breeding stock should pass the good qualities to their offspring for better performance, e.g., higher milk production or growth to improve the herd. Selection process repeated for many gene

e.g., higher milk production or growth to improve the herd. Selection process repeated for many generations increases chances of formation of desirable qualities in an animal. Selection increases occurrences of desirable genes and decreases that of the undesirable ones. There are two types of selection. Natural selection: This is the process in which animals that are better adapted to their environment get a better chance of surviving and producing more offspring than those that fail to adapt th

nment get a better chance of surviving and producing more offspring than those that fail to adapt themselves. The offspring of the adapted animals will be more adapted than their parents. Animals that are unable to adapt cannot survive or reproduce. Artificial selection: farmers select and mate the best animals. This increases the health and productivity of animals. There are several methods of artificial selection. Agriculture Grade 11 95 Animal Genetics and Breeding Practices Mass selection:

tificial selection. Agriculture Grade 11 95 Animal Genetics and Breeding Practices Mass selection: Animas are selected or rejected on the basis of their own performance in the field.

f the best performing offspring are retained while the mothers of offspring that do not perform well are culled (removed).  Family selection: Animals are selected or rejected on the basis of the performance of their relatives or family.

. Breeding Breeding involves the development of animals by transferring inherited qualities from parents to offspring. This is achieved through mating. There are different methods of breeding, which can be categorized as related or unrelated breeding systems. In-breeding: This involves mating of more closely related animals than the average of the population from which they come, e.g., the mating of father to daughter, son to mother or brother to sister. In-breeding helps to produce inbred lines

of father to daughter, son to mother or brother to sister. In-breeding helps to produce inbred lines that can be used for cross breeding to produce hybrid vigour. However, it can produce offspring with undesirable characteristics because recessive genes show up. This is known as in-breeding depression. Line-breeding: This involves the mating of distantly related animals, e.g., mating between cousins. It has the same disadvantages as in-breeding, but it takes a longer period for undesirable trait

ns. It has the same disadvantages as in-breeding, but it takes a longer period for undesirable traits to appear (i.e., for in-breeding depression to occur). It is used to consolidate traits for a particular outstanding ancestor. Most of the high-quality commercial characters developed recently have been a result of line-breeding. Out breeding: This is the mating of unrelated animals within the same breed. Out-breeding is the opposite of in-breeding. It produces offspring with a greater vigor and

e breed. Out-breeding is the opposite of in-breeding. It produces offspring with a greater vigor and productivity. Cross breeding: This is the mating of proven quality animals of same species but different breeds. This is because parental animals differ in gene composition. Cross-breeding results in breeds of animals with higher production capacity than any of the parents. This phenomenon is called heterosis or hybrid vigor. It brings about a greater rate of growth in an offspring. Cross-breedin

First, nutrition plays a very important role in maintaining the health and productivity of dairy cattle. Second, feed alone constitutes 60 to 70% of the production cost of milk. This is why feeding management plays a vital role in farm economy. This management involves feeding a balanced diet and avoiding overfeeding. Feed is of two types: roughage and concentrates.

Pasteurized milk Pasteurized milk is dairy milk that is heated to a high temperature and cooled using a simple heating process to destroy any harmful bacteria and micro-organisms. This also extends the shelf life. Supermarket milk is always pasteurized. During pasteurization, milk is heated to between 63 and 65°C for 20 to 30 min

The nature of soils is one of the major factors that determine crop productivity in an area. Soil properties that affect crop yields include the soil’s nutrient content, organic matter content, and soil reaction (acidity, alkalinity). Also, depth of top soil, soluble salt accumulation (salinity) and

Soil erosion removes valuable top soil, which is the most productive part of soils for agriculture. The loss of this productive top soil results in lower yields as essential nutrients that plants require for growth are washed away, and increased production costs. Moreover, the eroded soils may end up in water bodies including lakes rivers and streams and may resul

Soil acidification is a common form of chemical soil degradation in highland areas in Ethiopia, where average annual rainfall is high. It is caused by removal of basic nutrient ions such as potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium from top soils by water (called leaching) or in crop harvest and improper use of acid forming mineral fertilizers.

Acid soils are not suitable for plant growth or for activities of numerous soil organisms. For most crops, the most suitable soil pH is between 6.5 and 7.2. When pH values go below this range, it is not ideal for crop growth and is results in reduced agricultural productivity. Approximately, 40% of Ethiopian soils Agriculture Grade 11

Soil salinization refers to excessive accumulation of soluble salts in surface soils. This results from the use of salt-rich irrigation and insufficient drainage. Soil salinization is common in lowland areas where the amount of annual rainfall is low. When salt-rich irrigation water is used in these areas, due

e the amount of annual rainfall is low. When salt-rich irrigation water is used in these areas, due to high temperature in these environments, evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration) is high. So, when the water evaporates, dissolved salts remain behind and accumulate in the soil surface and cause salinization of soils. As shown in figure 10.4, accumulated soluble salts are visible as a white thin layer on soil surfaces. When soluble salt accumulation is high in soils, water may move f

When soluble salt accumulation is high in soils, water may move from plant roots back to the soil resulting in dehydration of plants causing yield decline or death of the plants. Soil salinization also restricts cropping options for farmers because only few crop species grow well in saline soils. Soil salinization problems are particularly common in the Ethiopian rift valley region. Figure 10.4. Degradation of soil by excess accumulation of soluble salts on the

te Change and Its Effects Climate change causes changes in rainfall amounts and patterns. Climate change causes an increase in global temperatures and the melting of icecaps and glaciers. Rise in the sea level and droughts that cause an increase in evaporation are consequences of climate change. Effects of climate change on agriculture In areas where agriculture is mainly dependent on rainfall, a decrease in rainfall, due to climate change, reduces water availability. An increase in temperature,

decrease in rainfall, due to climate change, reduces water availability. An increase in temperature, due to climate change, also increases water losses from soils and surface water resources. In both cases, there will be water shortage for growing crops and for animals and human consumption. In some areas, climate change can also cause increased rainfall. The increase in rainfall may result in increased soil erosion. When soils are eroded, nutrients that plants use for growth will be washed away

reased soil erosion. When soils are eroded, nutrients that plants use for growth will be washed away with the soils. This reduces nutrient availability for field crops and forages. The consequence will be a decrease in crop yields and animal productivity. Reduction in crop and livestock productivity is particularly harmful to societies that are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. Increased rainfall can also lead to damages of croplands and household properties. In addition to reducin

ased rainfall can also lead to damages of croplands and household properties. In addition to reducing crop and livestock productivity, global warming could increase the incidence of some crop and animal diseases. This results in the reduction of crop and livestock yields.

Effects of climate change on forestry Global warming and reduced water availability causes reduced vegetation growth, reduced productivity and loss of some tree species. This reduces the capacity of the forest to absorb carbon through photosynthesis. Degradation of the environment in the form of deforestation, soil erosion and disappearance of wildlife enhances desertification in arid and semi-arid areas. Gener

Generally, climate change results in reduced capacity of the forest to regulate the climate through carbon storage. The forest is a habitat for various organisms - plants, animals and microbes.

Income diversification Instead of depending totally on agriculture, farmers participate in off farm activities like trading, paid labor work and other activities.

 cropping Sometimes, more than one crop species is planted on the same farmland. This helps to use the soil resource efficiently and, during climate change, Agriculture Grade 11 217 Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation reduces the risk of total crop loss. In mixed cropping, crops have different tolerance to drought conditions. If one crop species fails to give yield, the other crop in the mixture provides some crop yield for the farmers.

sector for food and nutrition security. Agricultural food diversification is the act of introducing or producing a variety of food from agricultural activities. It is important to produce and consume different types of food. Different food types provide different nutrients that people need to be healthy. Children need a variety of food to grow well and develop properly. Adults need a variety of food to have energy and be productive. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need different foods fo

od to have energy and be productive. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need different foods for the baby and for themselves to be healthy and strong. Diversification of foods grown by a household can improve dietary diversity and nutrition outcomes. Different foods and food groups are good sources for various macro and micronutrients. This means a diverse diet is the best way of ensuring people have all the nutrients they need. Agricultural diversification or integrated farming systems inv

t. The diet often lacks animal source foods, (meat, fish, eggs and dairy products) and fruits and vegetables. Since the different food groups provide different benefits, consumption of diversified foods is important for the health of adults and proper growth and development of children. Strategies for food and dietary diversification at the community and household levels can maximize the availability of adequate amounts and greater variety of nutritious foods. Such activities include:  promotio

practice of deliberately increasing the content of an essential micronutrient, i.e., vitamins, minerals, and trace elements in a food. It aims to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply and provide a public health benefit with minimal risk to health. It reduces the number of people with dietary deficiencies within a population. Diets that lack variety can be deficient in certain nutrients. Sometimes the staple foods of a region can lack particular nutrients. Addition of micronutrients

ts. Sometimes the staple foods of a region can lack particular nutrients. Addition of micronutrients to staples and condiments can prevent large scale deficiencies. The FAO outlined that most common fortified foods are cereals and cereal- based products, milk/milk products, fats and oils, tea and other beverages and infant formulas. Food fortification is a sound public health strategy because it is cost effective, can reach large segments of at-risk populations through existing food delivery sys

 thrown away, a lot of nutrients are lost. Grains like wheat, barley, sorghum, etc. can be sprouted. These grains can then be dried in shade and roasted lightly. They can be ground and used in many dishes. Pulses are also sprouted first and then steamed and consumed. The time and water which each grain or pulse needs for soaking and sprouting is different. Normally, 8 to16 hours are needed for soaking and 12 to 24 hours for sprouting. The cloth in which the soaked grain or pulse is tied should b

When sprouting is followed by fermentation, the vitamin content becomes much more improved. Germination helps to increase the digestibility of foods. Some carbohydrates and proteins are broken down into smaller and easily digestible forms. Grains and pulses become soft after sprouting, so they take less time for cooking and are easy to digest. This means germination incr

The micro-organisms change nutrients already present in the foods into simpler and more easily digested forms and also make other new nutrients. Fermentation is what makes dough rise and become almost double in quantity. During fermentation the micro-organisms use up some of the nutrients present in the dough and change them into other better quality nutrients. They also

Fermentation has several advantages. Fermentation improves the digestibility of foods. The micro-organisms break the proteins and carbohydrates into smaller parts, which are easier to digest. During fermentation of cereals and foods (such as peas, chickpeas, beans, etc.), calcium, phosphorus, and iro

Fermented foods become spongy and soft. They are liked by children and adults. 16.3.4. Roasting Roasting is a cooking method that uses dry heat where hot air envelops the food. Roasting can enhance flavor of the food. Roasting uses indirect, diffused heat as in an oven. This is suitable for slower cooking of meat in a l

sting uses indirect, diffused heat as in an oven. This is suitable for slower cooking of meat in a larger, whole piece. Meats and most root and bulb vegetables can be roasted. In roasting, the heat seals the outside part of the food and the juice inside the food cooks the food. Roasting is mainly used when cooking fleshy food like fish, meat or chicken. When heat is applied to the outer covering of the food, it seals it up thereby trapping all the juices inside the food.Agriculture Grade 11 Dive
