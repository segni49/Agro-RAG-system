cuttings in which apportion of a stem, root, or leaf is cut from the parent plant, placed under certain favorable environmental conditions and induced to form roots and shoots. This produces a new, independent plant which is identical to the parent plant.

Fat deposition is sparse and yellow in color. There is a limited number of studies on goat meat efficiency. Efficiency is normally expressed as the amount of product/amount of feed input x 100. For energy in goats, this is 4.7% , and for protein 9.1%. This should not be confused with feed conversion efficiency, which is expressed

From the significant 53 crops cultivated in Ethiopia, 33 (62.2%) of them are dependent on biological pollinators. Besides, honey bees play a vital economic role, and their contribution to pollination service in agricultural crops is at around 0.815 billion dollars in Ethiopia, which is 6.24% of the agricultural GDP (Getachew, 2018).
